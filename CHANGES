 Scalar::Footnote Change Log
=============================

All changes by Steve Purkis unless otherwise noted.

0.99_02
    +	API changed, NOT BACKWARDS COMPAT!
	use Scalar::Footnote::Functions if you're already relying on this
	module, though this is strongly deprecated!
    +	Now attaches a Scalar::Footnote object by default, and keys footnotes
	so we don't have to worry about overwriting other people's footnotes.


0.99_01
    +	converted from Pixie::Info
    +	added remove_footnote()
    +	reworked XS to take a copy of the info scalar
    +	loads more tests & docs

Formerly Pixie::Info -- see Pixie changelog for more details.
